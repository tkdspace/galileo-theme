Third Dyslexic Kid (TDK) is a blog, sometimes a confession booth, by a serial chronic procrastinator who needs to figure his shit out. 

The name of this blog is a dyslexic bastardisation of the term Third Culture Kid (TCK), which refers to children of immigrants who spent their formative years in a country that is not their parents' homeland. They form a third culture, a result of the amalgamation of their home life and the outside world. TCK usually speak more than one language, supposedly have a broader worldview and are more culturally aware: which is bullshit speak for "grew up in another country". A non-rosy effect of being a TCK is that you feel like you don't belong anywhere, no roots or a place to call home. There's a nagging feeling that you're different (in a bad way) and your parents are either pushing you too hard or making excuses for your lack of achievements. 

If you are reading this, please forgive me and enjoy the ride. My hopes for this blog is to try to understand why I procrastinate so so much, to explore some of the negatives of being a TCK, and hopefully, to better understand why I do what I do. 

Thanks for reading,

TDK
